In my research, I focus on answering applied questions related to memory and memory-based decisions. My main aims are to help define practices that can be used to effectively elicit information, and to provide guidance that enables accurate and effective interpretation of memory-based evidence in investigative settings.

I study basic cognitive processes that impact memory-based decisions, situational factors that affect memory reports such as interviewing formats, social influences on memory such as cultural schemata or collaborative remembering, and applied implications associated with accurate and inaccurate memory. I also study conditions that are optimal for eyewitness to make accurate decisions, and evaluators' perceptions of evidence obtained from memory reports.

The core values of my lab are diversity, transparency, openness, and scholarship. My Open Science Framework page can be found [here](https://osf.io/v3p2k/).
