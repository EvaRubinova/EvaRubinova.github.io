Research in my lab focuses on answering applied questions related to memory and memory-based decisions. My main aims are to help define practices that can be used to effectively elicit information and to provide guidance that enables accurate and effective interpretation of memory-based evidence in investigative settings.

In the lab, we study basic cognitive processes that impact memory-based decisions, situational factors that affect memory reports such as interviewing formats, social influences on memory such as cultural schemata or collaborative remembering, and applied implications associated with accurate and inaccurate memory. We also study conditions that are optimal for eyewitness to make accurate decisions, and we study evaluators' perceptions of evidence obtained from memory reports. Research in the lab addresses questions such as:

*What kind of memory-based decisions do people make in specific situations?*
*How well can people remember events after they have experienced several occurrences?*
*How to best apporach interviewing if we want to obtain as complete and as accurate reports as possible?*

In basic memory and applied eyewitness memory paradigms, we use experimental methodology with basic (e.g., stories) as well as more ecologically valid stimuli (e.g., self-experienced events) to study the impact of specific manipulations and differences between procedures. We also use observational methodology to study associations within autobiographical memory that may help us validate experimental findings or open new avenues for investigation.

**The core values of my lab** include diversity, transparency, and open discussion, in addition to scholarship.
