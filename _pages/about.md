I focus on answering applied questions related to memory and memory-based decisions. My main aims are to help define practices that can be used to effectively elicit information, and to provide guidance that enables accurate and effective interpretation of memory-based evidence in investigative settings.

We study basic cognitive processes that impact memory-based decisions, situational factors that affect memory reports such as interviewing formats, social influences on memory such as cultural schemata or collaborative remembering, and applied implications associated with accurate and inaccurate memory. Next, we study conditions that are optimal for eyewitness to make accurate decisions and evaluators' perceptions of evidence obtained from memory reports.

In basic and applied eyewitness memory paradigms, we use experimental methodology to study the impact of specific manipulations and differences between procedures. We also use observational methodology to study associations within autobiographical memory that may help us validate experimental findings or open new avenues for investigation.

In addition to scholarship, the core values of the lab include diversity, transparency, and open discussion.
